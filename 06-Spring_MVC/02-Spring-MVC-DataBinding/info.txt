                    Spring Boot MVC Form of Data Binding

    In this programming, I have been learning the concepts of

    1. Data Binding :
        it is the process of automatically setting and retrieve the data from the java object or
        bean.
    2. learn Thymeleaf tags which include
        - th means thymeleaf tag
        - th:field :- This attribute is used to bind input fields to properties in a bean class
                      .i.e. model
        - th:action
        - th:object
        - th:text :- used to display the data from the model for user

        th:field="*{only define attributeName}" using this syntax for th:field="${object.attributeName}

    3. learn annotation
        - @ModelAttribute :-
            In spring boot, @ModelAttribute annotation is used to bind the data from the HTTP
            request to the javascript object, making it easier to work with form data and other
            request parameter.

    5. Using Thymeleaf tag

    6. How to send the List type of data over the Request.

Development process :
    1. Create Student class (model) :-
            - The 'Students' class is a model that represents student data.
            - it contain fields.
            - Each field has corresponding getter and setter method, to allowing get and set the values
              for these attributes.


    2. Create student controller class :- Note

            - In spring controller, Before you show the form you must add the 'Modelâ€™.

            - This is the bean that will hold form data for the data binding.

    3. Create HTML file

    4. Create form processing code in spring controller
        - when the form is submitted by the user, spring MVC binds the form data to the "Students" object.
        - And then, The binded student object data is displayed by use of Thymeleaf tag.

    5. Create another HTML form to show the processing form resut.
